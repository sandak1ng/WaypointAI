***Please ignore the folder "Waypoints/WaypointAI - added new stage with new technique used"*** - I tried to delete this but I couldn't for some reason...

For my project I decided to create a waypoint path finder, this was my task and my goal:
Waypoint Pathfinder - One or more agents navigating a space using a waypoint graph.  Stretch goal: automatically generate links between hand-placed waypoints. (Harder still is placing the waypoints automatically.)

I created two scenes, one which uses Unity's navigation mesh and the other using checkpoints to move the agent, the reason I created two was because I wanted to explore the different techniques to go about moving an agent from one place to another smoothly, so far there is no user input to my demo's all you need to do is run the program and you will see the agent move around automatically.

In my first scene, I am using navigation mesh which didn't require a lot of code, I simply declared a transform variable and then used "GetComponent< NavMeshAgent>" to update the position of the agent on every frame and that was it, I learnt that there's not much you need to code as Unity does it all for you, the unity navigation GUI was very helpful in helping me distinguish what was obstacles and what was walk-able terrain, I got a lot of help from the Unity documentation, everything I needed was basically described on there  I think there are many benefits to using nav meshes and I couldn't really find a lot of cons to it, even if you are not technically gifted in coding you are able to create amazing and intelligent AI movement using nav mesh. 

In my second scene, I am using waypoints/checkpoints that once the agent passes through it then moves onto the next checkpoint, I didn't use much code to achieve this but I was able to produce an effective AI movement although the downsides to this - it becomes a bit predictable after a while which can be okay depending on what you are trying to achieve. I am using transform again to update the position of the agent on every frame, a feature I wasn't able to achieve on this scene was the addition of raycasting, I wanted to create a line of sight AI that reacts to obstacles as well as the checkpoints.

In my third scene, it is more of an extension of the first I wanted to test multiple agents at a time. I used the built in nav mesh of unity and created multiple agents travelling to a destination set by me. I also added gates to test the dynamic nav mesh.
Controls for the third demo: 

"Space Bar" = Move Gate 1 (Closest to you)

"L" = Move Gate 2 (Furthest from you)

I wanted to create a fourth scene which allows user input to click and put down a destination for the agent to travel to while avoiding the obstacles in between however I ran into issues with the code and didn't have enough time to fix it.

I believe nav meshes are very efficient because they are simple enough to implement that you save so much time and can focus on other features of the game or even polish it even more to create more intelligent movement such as rotation, random movement between destinations etc. however on the other case, the only practical benefit to using waypoint graphs is where you want to restrict movement to exact lines rather than certain areas like nav mesh meaning that it is moderately cheaper to operate.
